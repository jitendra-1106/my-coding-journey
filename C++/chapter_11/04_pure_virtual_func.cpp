/*
Abstract Base Class:
--An abstract base class is designed to prevent the creation of its
own objects and to provide a common interface for derived classes.

--It contains at least one pure virtual function, declared using = 0.

--Derived classes must override all inherited pure virtual functions
to become concrete classes, whose objects can be created.

--If a derived class does not override all inherited pure virtual
functions, it also remains abstract, and its objects cannot be
created.
--The main purpose of an abstract base class is to ensure that derived
classes implement the required functions according to their needs.
